# ROADMAP

Actionable work only. Historical and completed roadmap material is archived in CHANGELOG.md; blocked work is kept in Roadmap_Blocked.md.

## Actionable Items

- [ ] P0 - Verify downloaded model artifacts
  Why: Current model downloads only check minimum byte size, so corrupt or replaced weights can be accepted.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` `ensure_model()`, `ensure_parsing_model()`, `ensure_matting_model()`; MediaPipe/yakhyo model URLs.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, model download/cache helpers, README model section.
  Acceptance: Each downloaded model is validated against a versioned manifest with SHA-256, expected size, source URL, and clear retry/failure UI/CLI output.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P0 - Add deterministic CLI and pipeline regression tests
  Why: The tracked tree has no tests, while the app now has many parser, manifest, export, and worker paths.
  Evidence: repo scan for tests; `FaceSlim_v1.py` `load_batch_manifest()`, `parse_face_overrides()`, `cli_process()`, `ExportThread`, `BatchThread`.
  Touches: `tests/`, `FaceSlim_v1.py`, fixture media, README test commands.
  Acceptance: Local test command covers preset listing, manifest parsing, face override validation, unsupported media handling, image export smoke, and worker cancellation without launching the GUI.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P0 - Surface export and FFmpeg failures through structured logs
  Why: Audio mux and some frame-processing errors can be swallowed or printed without durable user diagnostics.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` `ExportThread._mux_audio()` broad `pass`, `VideoThread.run()` print-only frame errors, README crash-log behavior.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, export threads, status bar/toast handling, crash/log file path.
  Acceptance: Every failed mux/export/frame-processing path writes a timestamped render log, updates GUI/CLI status, preserves the original output when rollback is needed, and returns non-zero in CLI mode on hard failure.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P0 - Repair reproducible local environment setup
  Why: The repo `.venv` points at a missing Python path on this machine, blocking the documented local verification path.
  Evidence: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` failure; `CLAUDE.md` key commands; `requirements.txt`.
  Touches: README setup section, `requirements.txt`, optional setup script, `CLAUDE.md`.
  Acceptance: A fresh checkout can create a working venv with one documented command, run `--list-presets`, and compile the main modules without relying on stale absolute interpreter paths.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P1 - Embed C2PA/IPTC provenance metadata on export
  Why: The optional visual watermark is useful but removable; platform policies and standards increasingly expect durable altered-media metadata.
  Evidence: C2PA 2.2, IPTC Photo Metadata, YouTube altered-content disclosure policy, `FaceSlim_v1.py` `apply_disclosure_watermark()` and `save_rgb_image()`.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, export pipeline, metadata preservation path, README disclosure section.
  Acceptance: Image exports can include C2PA/IPTC fields identifying FaceSlim editing, source preservation status, edit timestamp, and disclosure flag without stripping existing EXIF/ICC unless requested.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P1 - Add accessibility metadata and contrast/focus QA
  Why: The GUI has many custom controls and tooltips but no explicit accessible names/descriptions or automated focus/contrast checks.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` GUI construction around sliders/buttons; PyQt accessibility APIs; commercial editor UX expectations.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, UI construction helpers, screenshot/QA harness.
  Acceptance: Sliders, checkboxes, buttons, combo boxes, timeline, and preview controls expose accessible names/descriptions; dark/light contrast and tab focus order are verified by a repeatable local check.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 - Add large-media preflight and resource guardrails
  Why: Large videos and high-resolution images are processed without estimating memory, frame count, disk space, codec support, or output writability.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` `VideoCapture`/`VideoWriter` export loops; Real-ESRGAN tile-processing pattern; README DSLR/video claims.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, export dialog, CLI validation, batch queue.
  Acceptance: GUI/CLI report input resolution, duration/frame count, estimated output size/time, available disk space, codec availability, and a clear refusal/recovery path before long renders start.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 - Add runtime provider diagnostics and selector
  Why: ONNX providers are auto-selected, but users cannot see or compare CUDA, DirectML, CPU, or future provider choices.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` `FaceParsingEngine` and `MattingRefinementEngine`; ONNX Runtime provider release docs.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, settings UI, CLI flags, README troubleshooting.
  Acceptance: Settings/CLI show available providers, selected provider per model, a one-frame benchmark, fallback reason, and persisted override with safe fallback to CPU.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 - Create dependency and Python upgrade lane
  Why: The app pins MediaPipe 0.10.14, ONNX Runtime 1.18.1, OpenCV 4.10.0.84, NumPy 1.26.4, and Python 3.9+ while current PyPI and Python lifecycle data have moved on.
  Evidence: `requirements.txt`; PyPI version checks for MediaPipe/ONNX Runtime/OpenCV/NumPy; Python version status docs.
  Touches: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-docker.txt`, Dockerfile, PyInstaller spec, compatibility smoke tests.
  Acceptance: A compatibility matrix records supported Python/dependency versions, verifies Python 3.12+, tests ONNX Runtime upgrades, and documents any blockers before bumping pins.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P1 - Add model provenance and license panel
  Why: Users need to know which model is active, where it came from, its license/provenance, and whether it was verified.
  Evidence: README model table; `FaceSlim_v1.py` model constants; `Roadmap_Blocked.md` legal/model-choice note for 3DMM.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, Settings/Quality UI, CLI `--list-models`, README model section.
  Acceptance: GUI and CLI list installed/downloadable models with source URL, size, hash status, license note, active provider, cache path, and redownload action.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2 - Add optional restoration/upscale post-stage with identity control
  Why: GFPGAN, CodeFormer, Real-ESRGAN, Warlock-Studio, and Topaz/Remini show restoration/upscale is table-stakes, but it must be optional to avoid identity drift.
  Evidence: GFPGAN, CodeFormer fidelity control, Real-ESRGAN tiling, existing ROADMAP superres note.
  Touches: model registry, export pipeline, CLI flags, settings UI, README.
  Acceptance: Users can enable a post-stage model with face/background separation, strength/fidelity control, tile size, preview comparison, and CLI parity; default remains off.
  Complexity: XL

- [ ] P2 - Split the monolithic implementation into testable modules
  Why: One 3,700+ line file mixes download, inference, effects, GUI, threads, export, presets, and CLI logic, making regression coverage and plugin/API work harder.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` class/function inventory; Adobe UXP/local automation opportunity.
  Touches: `faceslim/` package modules, `FaceSlim.py`, `FaceSlim_v1.py`, PyInstaller spec, Dockerfile, tests.
  Acceptance: Public launch commands still work, but model management, pipeline effects, exporters, CLI, and UI live in separate modules with import-safe tests.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P2 - Add localization-ready UI strings
  Why: Commercial retouch tools are global, but FaceSlim strings are hard-coded throughout the PyQt UI and CLI.
  Evidence: `FaceSlim_v1.py` GUI labels/status strings; Facetune/YouCam/Meitu global product surfaces.
  Touches: `FaceSlim_v1.py`, translation resource files, README.
  Acceptance: UI/CLI strings are routed through a translation table, English remains default, and at least one pseudo-locale test catches clipping/overflow in the main controls.
  Complexity: M
